# future-gadget-lab

A Secret Lab led by a Mad Scientist to experiment stuff. It is my main backend API/Web application for testing various services, libraries, cloud deployment.

It's written with [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/), the web framework built on top of [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com)

.NET Core is the modular, open-source and high performance implementation of .NET for creating web applications and services that run on Windows, Linux and Mac and using the C# language.
