# future-gadget-lab
A Secret Lab led by a Mad Scientist to experiment stuff. It is my main backend API/Web application for testing various services, libraries, cloud deployment.

It's written with [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) in C# and can run on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS).

## Tools used
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): An awesome code editor with a good balance between a simple text editor and an IDE.
